Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\nThe aim of this project is to recommend suitable neighborhoods for new start-up entrepreneurs entering the business world in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Specifically, this report will be targeted to users who want to set up a new business with close proximity to places of interest or search category option. The recommendation should not only present the most viable option, but also present a comparison table of all possible venues.\n\nI will make use of my acquired data science skills to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by the users."
